# README

The [webpier](https://github.com/novemus/webpier) program is designed to exchange TCP services with remote hosts, including those located behind the NAT. Peers do not need to have public IP addresses and third-party relay servers. The 'webpier' creates a direct UDP tunnel between the hosts and imports the remote TCP service to the local interface, or exports the local TCP service to the remote side.

## Build

You can download [prebuild packages](https://github.com/novemus/webpier/releases) for Debian and Windows platforms.
