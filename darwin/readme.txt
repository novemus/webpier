README

The 'WebPier' app is designed to exchange TCP services with other hosts, including those located behind the NAT. Peers do not need to have public IP addresses and third-party relay servers are not used. The 'WebPier' creates a direct UDP tunnel between the hosts and maps the remote service to the local interface, or forwadrs the local service to the remote side. To overcome NAT is used well-known UDP-hole-punching technique, EMAIL or DHT are used as a rendezvous for exchanging endpoints.
